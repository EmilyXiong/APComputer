1.  If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House waite so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?
2.  The media tries so hard to make my move to the White House, as it pertains to my business, so complex - when actually it isn't!
3.  Thank you to Time Magazine and Financial Times for naming me "Person of the Year" - a great honor!
4.  Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine. Way down, big trouble, dead! Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out!

9.  The thing I like best about Rex Tillerson is that he has vast experience at dealing successfully with all types of foreign governments.
10.  Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have just certified my wins in those states. I actually picked up additional votes!
11.  I have chosen one of the truly great business leaders of the world, Rex Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, to be Secretary of State.
12.  I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times!
13.  Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office.
14.  Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the......
15.  I will be making my announcement on the next Secretary of State tomorrow morning.
16.  The final Wisconsin vote is in and guess what - we just picked up an additional 131 votes. The Dems and Green Party can now rest. Scam!

18.  The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.
19.  Unless you catch "hackers" in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election?
20.  Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!
21.  Just watched @NBCNightlyNews - So biased, inaccurate and bad, point after point. Just can't get much worse, although @CNN is right up there!
22.  Will be interviewed on @FoxNews at 10:00 P.M. Enjoy!
23.  Whether I choose him or not for "State"- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned!
24.  I spent Friday campaigning with John Kennedy, of the Great State of Louisiana, for the U.S.Senate. The election is over - JOHN WON!

31.  Reports by @CNN that I will be working on The Apprentice during my Presidency, even part time, are ridiculous & untrue - FAKE NEWS!
32.  As a show of support for our Armed Forces, I will be going to The Army-Navy Game today. Looking forward to it, should be fun!
33.  I have NOTHING to do with The Apprentice except for fact that I conceived it with Mark B & have a big stake in it. Will devote ZERO TIME!
34.  .@RudyGiuliani, one of the finest people I know and a former GREAT Mayor of N.Y.C., just took himself out of consideration for "State".

42.  If United Steelworkers 1999 was any good, they would have kept those jobs in Indiana. Spend more time working-less time talking. Reduce dues
43.  Chuck Jones, who is President of United Steelworkers 1999, has done a terrible job representing workers. No wonder companies flee country!

92.  My thoughts and prayers are with the great people of Tennessee during these terrible wildfires. Stay safe!
93.  Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!
94.  I thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however, since election, they are worse!
95.  The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory - 306!
96.  .@CNN is so embarrassed by their total  (100%) support of Hillary Clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they don't know what to do.
97.  "@sdcritic:  @HighonHillcrest @jeffzeleny @CNN There is NO QUESTION THAT #voterfraud did take place, and in favor of #CorruptHillary !"

127.  Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes. In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!
128.  I cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice

134.  I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?

138.  Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!
139.  The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!
140.  I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.

145.  My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGA
146.  Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me.
147.  I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan,
148.  The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.
149.  I am not trying to get "top level security clearance" for my children. This was a typically false news story.
150.  Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!
151.  The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!
152.  If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in  N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily
153.  The debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win!
154.  I will be interviewed on @60Minutes tonight after the NFL game - 7:00 P.M. Enjoy!
155.  The @nytimes states today that DJT believes "more countries should acquire nuclear weapons." How dishonest are they. I never said this!
156.  Governor John Kasich of the GREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win. The people of Ohio were incredible!
157.  Jeb Bush, George W and George H.W. all called to express their best wishes on the win. Very nice!
158.  Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice!
159.  The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?
160.  Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena"
161.  This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win!

791.  Melania and I extend our warmest greetings to those observing Rosh Hashanah here in the United States, in Israel, and around the world.
792.  Bernie should pull his endorsement of Crooked Hillary after she decieved him and then attacked him and his supporters.
793.  "@trumplican2016: .@realDonaldTrump  There will be MASSIVE turnout for you,  Mr. Trump - These polls don't register the pulse of the PEOPLE!
794.  I have created tens of thousands of jobs and will bring back great American prosperity. Hillary has only created jobs at the FBI and DOJ!
795.  I know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them. #failing@nytimes
796.  Heading to Pennsylvania for a big rally tonight. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
797.  Wow, just saw the really bad @CNN ratings. People don't want to watch bad product that only builds up Crooked Hillary.
798.  The so-called Commission on Presidential Debates admitted to us that the DJT audio & sound level was very bad. So why didn't they fix it?
799.  I won the debate if you decide without watching the totally one-sided "spin" that followed. This despite the really bad microphone.

808.  Remember, don't believe "sources said" by the VERY dishonest media. If they don't name the sources, the sources don't exist.
809.  Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?
810.  Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con.
811.  Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an "angel" without checking her past, which is terrible!
812.  Anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying "sources said," DO NOT believe it. There are no sources, they are just made up lies!
813.  Wow, did you see how badly @CNN (Clinton News Network) is doing in the ratings. With people like @donlemon, who could expect any more?

https://t.co/G5TMAUzy0z
1000.  The seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits!
1001.  Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!
1002.  RT @BarackObama: RT if you agree: We need a President who is fighting for all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half the country.
1003.  While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!
1004.  Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER!
1005.  Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!
1006.  Will be in Missouri today with Melania for the funeral of a wonderful and truly respected woman, Phyllis S!
1007.  "@Stvzbnk: Just Watched @tonyschwartz. Obviously Tony is a Total Whack Job @realDonaldTrump"
1008.  Just returned from Pensacola, Florida, where the crowd was incredible.
1009.  I havn't seen @tonyschwartz in many years, he hardly knows me. Never liked his style. Super lib, Crooked H supporter. Irrelevant dope!
1010.  Dummy writer @tonyschwartz, who wanted to do a second book with me for years (I said no), is now a hostile basket case who feels jilted!
1011.  Thank you Florida - we are going to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Join us: https://t.co/3KWOl2ibaW.

1015.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
#AmericaFirst #ImWithYou https://t.co/JIlNW7myEN
1016.  Henry McMaster, Lt. Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me, beat failed @CNN announcer Bakari Sellers, so badly. Funny!
1017.  RT @EricTrump: Join @TeamTrump on Saturday for National Day of Action as we work to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! https://t.co/hyclkzPoBR https:/…
1018.  Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing @CNN.
1019.  .@CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They
are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign.
1020.  The documentary of me that @CNN just aired is a total waste of time. I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. A joke!
1021.  Final poll results from NBC on last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. Thank you! #ImWithYou #MAGA https://t.co/C5ipaxUN7B
1022.  It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail.
1023.  More poll results from last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. 
#AmericaFirst #TrumpTrain https://t.co/FxyBL6fO1h
1024.  Last nights results - in poll taken by NBC. #AmericaFirst #ImWithYou https://t.co/sCOnny1fl3
1025.  With Luis, Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted.
1026.  Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Peña Nieto.
1027.  Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.
1028.  Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media!
1029.  RT @DanScavino: Last nights winner was clear & it will be proven time & time again - lets #MAGA!! Lets WIN!! #TrumpTrain https://t.co/sGqp9…
1030.  "A rough night for Hillary Clinton"  ABC News.

1047.  Mainstream media never covered Hillary’s massive “hacking”
or coughing attack, yet it is #1 trending. What’s up?
1048.  "@Ler: Message for undecided voters: Please wake up and vote DonaldTrump now! Trump/Pence very important save our America before too late!"
1049.  Thank you! #AmericaFirst https://t.co/6v4C8ykDVl
1050.  As a tribute to the late, great Phyllis Schlafly, I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book, THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP.
1051.  China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama "the son of a whore." Terrible!
1052.  The truly great Phyllis Schlafly, who honored me with her strong endorsement for president, has passed away at 92. She was very special!
1053.  Thank you Ohio! #AmericaFirst https://t.co/p68GAJdhwu

1057.  Can you believe that the Chinese would not give Obama the proper stairway to get off his plane - fight on tarmac! https://t.co/FAldS5zZi5
1058.  President Obama & Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new? Obama is not a natural deal maker. Only makes bad deals!
1059.  "@OSPREY675: @Miami4Trump I followed you because you are a patriot & support @realDonaldTrump, as do I. #MAGA by sticking together.
1060.  "@tweak626: I'm at a biker rally in Perry, Kansas...and everyone is a @realDonaldTrump fan. Love it."
1061.  "@ronnieclemmons: @ChrisCJackson @TakouiS @realDonaldTrump  Trump now leads her by 2 - get real, she will lose big"
1062.  "@lblackvelvet: @realDonaldTrump We need to show Americans that Hillary will KILL our Country !! Vote for Trump !!"
1063.  "@CherNuna: @realDonaldTrump It defies belief the Web of Lies Hillary is spinning! One excuse after another. Then it's this, then it's that.
1064.  Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the "C" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening?
1065.  To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years, high crime, poor schools, no jobs. I will fix it, VOTE "T"
1066.  The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?
1067.  The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake. Sad!
1068.  The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration.
1069.  RT @DanScavino: Doesn't fit the MSM narrative - so they wont share what @realDonaldTrump did for Jesse Jackson in 1999 - so I will! https:/…
1070.  "@AnneBellar: @realDonaldTrump @CNN CNN is so biased. Never ever watch them. Trump 2016!!"
1071.  Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term!
1072.  Wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source
1073.  .@CNN is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.
1074.  Great visit to Detroit church, fantastic reception, and all @CNN talks about is a small protest outside. Inside a large and wonderful crowd!

1097.  Hillary Clinton didn't go to Louisiana, and now she didn't go to Mexico. She doesn't have the drive or stamina to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1098.  Former President Vicente Fox, who is railing against my visit to Mexico today, also invited me when he apologized for using the "f bomb."

1112.  Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities, they want TRUMP!
1113.  Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or, as stated by Bernie S, she has BAD JUDGEMENT
1114.  Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary, who tried so hard, was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D.C. She was forced to go elsewhere
1115.  "@PMNOrlando: @realDonaldTrump I know of NO ONE voting for Crooked Hillary! Her rallies are held in (blank)  & she still has room.

1146.  Wonderful @pastormarkburns was attacked viciously and unfairly on @MSNBC by crazy @morningmika on low ratings @Morning_Joe. Apologize!

Full speech transcript: https://t.co/npswT6lbg3
1155.  Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy, and always very short (stamina). Media gives her a pass!
1156.  HRC is using the oldest play in the Dem playbook- when their policies fail, they are left w/this one tired argument!
https://t.co/FNbCMmwLTn
1157.  Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!
1158.  Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!
1159.  Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!
1160.  So many in the African-American community are doing so badly, poverty and crime way up, employment and jobs way down: I will fix it, promise

1176.  President Obama should have gone to Louisiana days ago, instead of golfing. Too little, too late!
1177.  Hillary Clinton strongly stated  that there was "absolutely no connection" between her private work and that of The State Department. LIE!
1178.  It is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact,  that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history!
1179.  I am now in Texas doing a big fundraiser for the Republican Party and a @FoxNews Special on the BORDER and with victims of border crime!
1180.  The @WashingtonPost quickly put together a hit job book on me- comprised of copies of some of their inaccurate stories. Don't buy, boring!
1181.  .@AnnCoulter's new book, 'In Trump We Trust, comes out tomorrow. People are saying it's terrific - knowing Ann I am sure it is!

1193.  I heard that @Morning_Joe was very nice on Friday but that little Donny D, a big failure in TV (& someone I helped), was nasty. Irrelevant!
1194.  Crooked Hillary is flooding the airwaves with false and misleading ads - all paid for by her bosses on Wall Street. Media is protecting her!
1195.  I have been drawing very big and enthusiastic crowds, but the media refuses to show or discuss them. Something very big is happening!

1229.  Just as we won the Cold War, in part, by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets....
Cont: https://t.co/SXp7efXEZU
1230.  This is my pledge to the American people: https://t.co/Jb21oyNfxt
1231.  'It's just a 2-point race, Clinton 38%, Trump 36%' https://t.co/EzDzJ4EzIN
1232.  Another health insurer is pulling back due to 'persistent financial losses on #Obamacare plans.' Only the beginning! https://t.co/YqfaEvg8c3
1233.  #AmericasMerkel https://t.co/QFRs4bEUC1
1234.  "CLINTON REFUGEE PLAN COULD BRING IN 620,000 REFUGEES IN FIRST TERM AT LIFETIME COST OF OVER $400 BILLION." https://t.co/COZQNt6KVs
1235.  #MakeAmericaSafeAgain 
https://t.co/bgBGPaKaqI
1236.  Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!
1237.  "Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!
1238.  I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
1239.  It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
1240.  I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!
1241.  Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
1242.  My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
1243.  If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%
1244.  The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said
1245.  The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!
1246.  "@zulu_out: You are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #USA Loves U" Thanks
1247.  "@PaulaDuvall2: We're all enjoying you, as well, Mr. T.! You've inspired Hope and a Positive Spirit throughout America! God bless you!" Nice
1248.  "@need2knowu:  @willspeakout yes you are my hero I admire you for laying down your glorious luxurious life to get beat up for America!!!"
1249.  We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.
1250.  "@willspeakout: Thank you for all that you are doing for us! You campaign endlessly and have spent millions.We love you! #TrumpTrain" Thanks
1251.  I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!
1252.  The failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest!
1253.  Will be on @seanhannity tonight at 10pm, hosted by @GovMikeHuckabee. Enjoy!
1254.  Thank you Erie, Pennsylvania! Together we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! https://t.co/5hZp7PnRoT
1255.  Unbelievable support in Florida last night - thank you! #MAGA https://t.co/WNDAagFRRS
1256.  ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State. When will the dishonest media report the facts!
1257.  I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!
1258.  A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!
1259.  "@laurencristmann: Thank you for coming to Pennsylvania today. I will be there with @C_Lynne_Ryan your 3rd CD delegate at 2 pm"
1260.  Ratings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) "the founder" of ISIS, & MVP. THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?
1261.  "@EnemyWithinn: @realDonaldTrump @elsolarverde @nytimes People gotta stop believing media lies about Trump." That would indeed be nice!
1262.  "@elsolarverde: THE CORRUPT MEDIA CREATS CONTROVERSY AGAINST @realDonaldTrump TO AVOID ISSUES ABOUT HillaryClinton https://t.co/RW5UcWLfA8"
1263.  "@SheriffClarke: https://t.co/G9R9CGhf8q Everything coming from this administration is a lie. Only @realDonaldTrump will change it"
1264.  Will be doing @oreillyfactor tonight at 8pm. Enjoy!
1265.  This is no surprise. Constant phony reporting from failing @CNN turns everyone off. The American people get it! https://t.co/a1A6XMfYx1
1266.  Thank you Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/cjivzdRpU1
1267.  Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.
1268.  Reuters just announced that Secret Service never spoke to me or my campaign. Made up story by @CNN is a hoax. Totally dishonest.
1269.  "@DSF2020: Really admire your determination: Working so hard for all Americans n daily having to defend yourself from a biased Media."
1270.  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! https://t.co/8rWz6p1Ged

1275.  My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers shot in Sebastian County, Arkansas. #LESM
1276.  Morning Joe's weakness is its low ratings. I don't watch anymore but I heard he went wild against Rudy Giuliani and #2A - sad & irrelevant!
1277.  .@dbongino  You were fantastic in defending both the Second Amendment and me last night on @CNN. Don Lemon is a lightweight - dumb as a rock
1278.  "@dbongino: ‘Now cut off my mic!’ Bongino refuses to be bullied by Don Lemon over Trump, 2nd Amendment – HEATED! https://t.co/UgtfaUXzcr"
1279.  Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance. I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!
1280.  When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed, like Libya, open borders, and maybe her emails?
1281.  Thank you Senator @ChuckGrassley! #TrumpPence16
https://t.co/YmdH3fcaeW

1289.  "@sprts08: @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends great interview.....all solid points on our economy TRUMP2016"
1290.  I am running against the Washington insiders, just like I did in the Republican Primaries. These are the people that have made U.S. a mess!
1291.  Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends now!
1292.  Being in Detroit today was wonderful. Quick stop in Ohio to meet with some of our great supporters. Just got back home!
1293.  RT @FieldofFight: We Can Do Better, We Must Do Better, We Will Do Better 
By LTG (R) Keith Kellogg and LTG (R) Michael Flynn @GenFlynn http…
1294.  'As Senator Clinton promised 200,000 jobs in Upstate New York - her efforts fell flat.' https://t.co/I2WqZb5N8P https://t.co/i5S3mtJWpe
1295.  Many people are saying that the Iranians killed the scientist who helped the U.S. because of Hillary Clinton's hacked emails.

1306.  #ICYMI: "Will Media Apologize to Trump?" https://t.co/ia7rKBmioA
1307.  Michael Morell, the lightweight former Acting Director of C.I.A., and a man who has made serious bad calls, is a total Clinton flunky!
1308.  The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, "the baby" and so much more. Very dishonest!
1309.  RT @DRUDGE_REPORT: CLINTON EMAIL LED TO EXECUTION IN IRAN? https://t.co/4rY1faptL6
1310.  I see where Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore is pushing Crooked hard. Look at the job she has done in Baltimore. She is a joke!
1311.  Thank you Windham, New Hampshire! #TrumpPence16 #MAGA https://t.co/ZL4Q01Q49s

https://t.co/I0zJO2sZKk
1315.  Heading to New Hampshire - will be talking about Hillary saying her brain SHORT CIRCUITED, and other things!
1316.  Anybody whose mind "SHORT CIRCUITS" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word "BRAINWASHED."
1317.  Crooked Hillary said loudly, and for the world to see, that she "SHORT CIRCUITED" when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous!
1318.  Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!
1319.  Good luck #TeamUSA

1327.  Hillary Clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President.
https://t.co/3EzG620fpT
1328.  The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!
1329.  President Obama refuses to answer question about Iran terror funding.  I won't dodge questions as your President. https://t.co/jsAMGO3s4P
1330.  Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS, rise of Iran, and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression!
1331.  President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie.

1362.  When will CNN do a segment on Hillary’s plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?
1363.  Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.
1364.  Hillary, whose decisions have led to the deaths of many, accepted $ from a business linked to ISIS. Silence at CNN. https://t.co/gJYSSXtpaz

1368.  People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!
1369.  The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.
1370.  Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?
1371.  When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?
1372.  CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs.
1373.  CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.
1374.  Join Governor Mike Pence in Reno, Nevada- tonight at 7pm! Tickets available at: https://t.co/4nLjRGyFYw

https://t.co/oHI6xrDJU0
1376.  So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!
1377.  When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down," I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!
1378.  This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!
1379.  Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!
1380.  Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable!
1381.  "@RealJamesWoods:  Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldn't stand a chance. #VoterFraud and #MSM her only hope."
1382.  The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?
1383.  I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!
1384.  Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it!
1385.  Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.  CLINTON 27.8 MILLION.  Thank you!
1386.  Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.
1387.  Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! @CNN @FoxNews
1388.  NATO commander agrees members should pay up via @dcexaminer:
https://t.co/VZLDFy707K
1389.  Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!
1390.  The "Rust Belt" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!
1391.  Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP
1392.  #CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. https://t.co/y9WJoUaaql
1393.  Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
1394.  I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!
1395.  Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings
1396.  #CrookedHillary https://t.co/xyoPFJmByp
1397.  Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!
1398.  Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.
1399.  Just got back from Colorado. The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds!
1400.  While I am in OH & PA - you can also join @Mike_Pence in Nevada on Mon!

1403.  We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.
1404.  Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars, 
NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.
1405.  Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country.

1417.  I am watching Crooked Hillary speak. Same old stuff, our country needs change!
1418.  Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V.P. pick!
1419.  In Hillary Clinton's America - things get worse. #TrumpPence16 https://t.co/WdHbnhhCbW
1420.  The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech. He wishes he didn't make that deal!

1422.  Crooked Hillary said that I "couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign." Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!
1423.  If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town!  #NeverHillary
1424.  "Little" Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!
1425.  General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD  #NeverHillary
1426.  Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!
1427.  Join @mike_pence at the University of Northwestern Ohio- tonight at 7pm. Tickets: https://t.co/DvP8p7ueNU

1429.  CAMPAIGN STATEMENT: 
https://t.co/RNW3ED2ifR
1430.  Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER!
1431.  Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!
1432.  The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!
1433.  No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
1434.  Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.
1435.  Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.
1436.  Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!
1437.  Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
1438.  Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.
1439.  Departing now - thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This is a MOVEMENT! https://t.co/ezrqVqPtta
1440.  #CrookedHillary https://t.co/JeXFnO6e3s

1442.  Great to be back in Iowa! #TBT with @JerryJrFalwell joining me in Davenport- this past winter. #MAGA https://t.co/A5IF0QHnic
1443.  Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office. It will only go further down under Clinton.
1444.  A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees.
1445.  AMERICA'S FUTURE

1454.  Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair.

1464.  Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
1465.  Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!
1466.  Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
1467.  Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
1468.  The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
1469.  Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st!
1470.  As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.
1471.  Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. 
https://t.co/eoNTWK6I8y
1472.  Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?
1473.  I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!
1474.  No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!
1475.  You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkelly
1476.  For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.
1477.  In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!
1478.  Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
1479.  Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!
1480.  The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!
1481.  Thank you New Hampshire!

1484.  Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.
1485.  Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great
1486.  Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference
1487.  Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.
1488.  Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!
1489.  Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
1490.  If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.
1491.  I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!
1492.  Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!
1493.  While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
1494.  Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.

1499.  Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA
1500.  The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!
1501.  Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
1502.  Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!
1503.  Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.
1504.  If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.
1505.  Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam
1506.  Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
1507.  How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!
1508.  The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me
1509.  Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!
1510.  The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!
1511.  The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!
1512.  The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!
1513.  Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
1514.  Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out
1515.  If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild
1516.  The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!
1517.  I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
1518.  Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)
1519.  Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!
1520.  There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!
1521.  An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
1522.  Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!
1523.  Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
1524.  Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT
1525.  The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!

1529.  Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!
1530.  The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!
1531.  Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
1532.  I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
1533.  Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
1534.  Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
1535.  Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
1536.  Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED
1537.  Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!
1538.  Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!
1539.  The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?
1540.  "@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain"
1541.  I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
1542.  Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?
1543.  Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.

https://t.co/uzBOm21Pug
1570.  The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.
1571.  Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!
1572.  In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!
1573.  Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.
1574.  Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!
1575.  Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST!

1583.  Networks other than low ratings @CNN have been very fair and exciting!
1584.  .@CNN is the worst.They go to their dumb, one-sided panels when a podium speaker is for Trump! VAST MAJORITY want: Make America Great Again!
1585.  Looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife, Melania. Place looks beautiful!

1588.  President Obama just had a news conference, but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse!
1589.  Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. We are not looking good, we are not looking smart, we are not looking tough!
1590.  "@60Minutes: DonaldTrump and his running mate @Mike_Pence to appear on #60Minutes in first joint interview. CBS https://t.co/lZH7qw9qmu"
1591.  I will be on @60Minutes tonight at 7:00 P.M. with Mike Pence talking about LAW AND ORDER and many other subjects! Bad times for divided USA!
1592.  We are TRYING to fight ISIS, and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching
1593.  We grieve for the officers killed in Baton Rouge today. How many law enforcement and people have to...
https://t.co/pPNrzG8kEa
1594.  The ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN - not even close. That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like
1595.  .@FoxNews is much better, and far more truthful, than @CNN, which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don't watch.
1596.  If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H
1597.  I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!
1598.  It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!
1599.  As the days and weeks go by,  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!
1600.  We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again!
1601.  Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con it's over
1602.  Thank you to Jack Morgan, Tamara Neo, Cheryl Ann Kraft and all of my friends and supporters in Virginia. GREAT JOB!

1605.  Thank you! #TrumpPence16 https://t.co/RHprMCsGT6
1606.  Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street, lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!
1607.  Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, Crooked Hillary Clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!
1608.  Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening!
1609.  Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have done

1613.  Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable. Look what has happened to the world with O & Hillary!
1614.  #NeverTrump is never more. They were crushed last night in Cleveland at Rules Committee by a vote of 87-12. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1615.  My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice, France. We are with you in every way!
1616.  In light of the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement.
1617.  Another horrific attack, this time in Nice, France. Many dead and injured. When will we learn? It is only getting worse.
1618.  I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Crooked Hillary will sell us out, just like her husband did with NAFTA.
1619.  Another new poll. Thank you for your support! Join the MOVEMENT today!

1621.  I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow.
1622.  If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!
1623.  Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?
1624.  Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!
1625.  On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.
1626.  Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.
1627.  Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!
1628.  Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common. https://t.co/teoVCYXKOR
1629.  Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!
1630.  The Republican platform is most 
pro-Israel of all time!
1631.  New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall. We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
1632.  #CrookedHillary is outspending me by a combined 31 to 1 in Florida, Ohio, & Pennsylvania. I haven't started yet! https://t.co/BcoPrwqFMe

1634.  Thank you! #ImWithYou https://t.co/6XkUQ0W4QS
1635.  Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign!

1639.  The American people agree. No free pass for #CrookedHillary! https://t.co/lTjLVKkzh1
1640.  To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests, we welcome you with open arms. People first.
1641.  Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.
1642.  Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.
1643.  #CrookedHillary is not qualified!
https://t.co/6qi7KTW43O
1644.  I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!
1645.  Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!
1646.  This election is a choice between law, order & safety - or chaos, crime & violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou
1647.  For too many years, our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need.
1648.  Crime is out of control, and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities. Not good!

1655.  I heard that the underachieving John King of @CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies. Happily, few people are watching - dead network!
1656.  The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!
1657.  President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!
1658.  Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!
1659.  New poll - thank you! #Trump2016
https://t.co/Mi87Vmw06H https://t.co/WmqvcYG4r3

https://t.co/m0AJWlV8nm https://t.co/P0GleHEmJy
1662.  Isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on @CNN?
1663.  Due to the horrific events taking place in our country, I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami.
1664.  Last night's horrific execution-style shootings of 12 Dallas law enforcement officers...https://t.co/mwzYU98yTt
1665.  Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country

1674.  Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live.
1675.  I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes, @MarkHalperin @NBCPolitics
1676.  Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.
1677.  Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.
1678.  Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City
1679.  I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.
1680.  Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come!
1681.  The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges, but...https://t.co/KO64IAMDgj https://t.co/8CBSfNpl2l
1682.  Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.
1683.  Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." Not fit!
1684.  Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
1685.  I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8, she's out!
1686.  Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win
1687.  I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 11pm. Enjoy!
1688.  My son, @EricTrump will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on @FoxNews. Enjoy!
1689.  Looking forward to meeting with @SenBobCorker in a little while. We will be traveling to North Carolina together today.
1690.  FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem
1691.  The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment.
1692.  It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!
1693.  Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!
1694.  On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. "Special: Meet the Trumps" Hope you enjoy!
1695.  Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
1696.  With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!
1697.  Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?
1698.  The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!
1699.  I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!
1700.  Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people!
1701.  Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid!
1702.  Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star!
1703.  Happy 4th of July! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst https://t.co/Ndb3AQrLtY https://t.co/YhHyQjwJW6
1704.  Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!
1705.  The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!
1706.  In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!
1707.  I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
1708.  The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures."
1709.  Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?
1710.  "THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"
1711.  On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!
1712.  Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt!
1713.  Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
1714.  Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it!
1715.  It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!
1716.  It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!
1717.  Thank you @greta. #ImWithYou https://t.co/SLdqNhD4Tm

1725.  The speakers slots at the Republican Convention are totally filled, with a long waiting list of those that want to speak - Wednesday release
1726.  Just read in the failing @nytimes that I was not aware "the event had to be held in Cleveland" - a total lie. These people are sick!
1727.  When you can't say it - or see it -- you can't fix it. We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! #ImWithYou #AmericaFirst https://t.co/Vd2A747L29

1734.  .@TraceAdkins great job on FOX this morning. Keep up the good work!
1735.  Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
1736.  Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
1737.  As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!
1738.  #ThrowbackThursday #Trump2016
https://t.co/gFtspBViXe
1739.  I will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on FOX! Enjoy!
1740.  The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1741.  I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!
1742.  The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!
1743.  One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America. 
https://t.co/mO9QrmYXRD
1744.  Why would college graduates want Crooked Hillary as their President? She will destroy them!

1747.  RT @DRUDGE_REPORT: 43-39 https://t.co/TkQYb6V2do
1748.  For reasons only they can explain, the @USChamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better.
1749.  Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine. Thank you to everyone for making it so special!
1750.  "@Gengm7: @jakeda @realDonaldTrump As of April this year, Hillary had spent $264,000,000 on her campaign Mr.Trump $55,000,000. self funding"
1751.  I will be on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!
1752.  ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!

1755.  Just watched Senator John Barrasso on @FoxNews - He was great! Thank you John.
1756.  Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?
1757.  The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China, and many others, are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts
1758.  Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!
1759.  "@jtsbk:  @AllenWest thanks for sharing Eric we need @realDonaldTrump now as this administration is incapable of keeping our country safe"
1760.  We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.
1761.  Yet another terrorist attack, this time in Turkey. Will
the world ever realize what is going on? So sad.
1762.  Hillary Clinton’s Presidency would be catastrophic for
the future of our country. She is ill-fit with bad judgment.
1763.  Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure. It just
never seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton.

1771.  .@CNN is all negative when it comes to me. I don't watch it anymore.
1772.  The media is unrelenting. They will only go with and report a story in a negative light. I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong), watch November
1773.  Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate, goofy Elizabeth Warren, who lied on heritage.
1774.  "@LindaSuhler: Trump voters don't scare or back down. Our numbers are growing & we're taking our country BACK. #Trump2016🇺🇸 #MAGA

1777.  "@JimVitari:  @ABC @washingtonpost we know they're fake just like poles during primary. I'm sure u will crush #CrookedHillary in general"
1778.  The "dirty" poll done by @ABC @washingtonpost is a disgrace. Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled. Other polls were good.
1779.  Crooked Hillary Attacks Foreign Government Donations - While Ignoring Her Own: https://t.co/pr3BSHJSxL
1780.  Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong. I said LEAVE will win. She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. Only a question of time
1781.  Hillary Clinton is not a change agent, just the same old status quo! She is spending a fortune, I am spending very little. Close in polls!
1782.  People in our country want borders, and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win. It is time for CHANGE -- and JOBS!
1783.  Top 50 Facts About Crooked Hillary Clinton From Trump 'Stakes Of The Election' Address: https://t.co/lfUdXYnsgJ
1784.  The @ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats.  Very dishonest - why would they do that? Other polls good!
1785.  Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot, but I never did = lie! Was there to support son
1786.  Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!
1787.  Crooked Hillary Clinton, who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama), is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call.
1788.  George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls
1789.  Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son, Eric, did a great job - under budget!
1790.  Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!
1791.  I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!
